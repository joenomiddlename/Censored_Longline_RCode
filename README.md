# Censored_Longline_RCode
A repository storing all the R code used to run the simulation experiments and case study seen in the paper: *A statistical censoring approach accounts for hook competition in abundance indices from longline surveys*

All seven simulation experiments, including code and intermediary rds files, can be found in the folder: *Simulation Experiments*

The code and results files for the case study can be found in the folder: *Case Study*

All the figures and results seen in the manuscript can be reproduced using the code found in this repository. If you run into any issues, please make an issue - I will respond as quickly as possible!

Note: the easiest way to use this repository is to download it as a zip file by clicking the green 'Code' button seen in the top-right of the main page, or clone the repository if you are familiar with using Git.
